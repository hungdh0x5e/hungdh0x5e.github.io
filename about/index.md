I'm backend developer with Golang, Ruby on Rails.

With a keen interest in command-line interfaces: terminal & tmux, Zsh & Neovim, lazygit, jq, ...

Like many other developers, I also use a custom mechanical keyboard: [QK65](https://qwertykeys.notion.site/QK65-Mirror-Restock-Sale-Info-82d77e08ffe043be99838bee46b776ed), plate FR4, switch Lavender, keycap Classical

And many other high-end technology stuff...
